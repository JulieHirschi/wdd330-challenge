                <h2>Legos 4 Literacy is based on a real success scenario.</h2>
                <p>A mother, in her quest to motivate her young child to become a better reader, would use Legos as a
                    reward for reading. She knew that her child liked to build and play with Legos and the Mother wanted
                    this child to be a better reader. It worked so well that it was decided to use her approach and
                    begin this non-profit organization. Now more children can receive Legos regardless of economic or
                    social standing, in an effort to increase literacy.
                </p>
                <p>Legos are known for being a great educational tool that helps stimulate creativity and learning
                    skills.
                    Legos cane to America in 1962 and it has evolved into a highly successful and sot after product.
                    Legos are popular among both boys and girls of all ages and has a variety of themed sets. They help
                    to instill creative play. Legos 4 Literacy is a non-profit organization that helps track the
                    progress of individual readers as they read and redeem points earned for Legos. It is a small step
                    to try and help increase literacy by offering a fun and creative reward that anyone with the desire
                    can succeed.</p>
