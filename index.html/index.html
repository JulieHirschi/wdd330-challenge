                <h2>Legos 4 Literacy is based on a real success scenario.</h2>
                <p>A mother, in her desire to motivate her young child to become a better reader, would use Legos as a
                    reward for reading. She knew that her child liked to build and play with Legos and the Mother wanted
                    this child to be a better reader. It worked so well that it was decided to use her approach and
                    begin this non-profit organization. Now more children can receive Legos regardless of economic or
                    social standing, in an effort to increase literacy.
                </p>
